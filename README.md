The program concerned the sorting of data from movie rentals. It has been divided into four subqueries. The first code was to answer the question: "What are the most popular types, titles and categories of rented movies and what is the number of rentals?" The second responded: "Find the 10 most active users. Provide their name, user ID and number of rentals for their favorite movie category." The third code answered the question: "Provide the same data as in the previous question regarding the ten users who spend the most on videos in their favorite category. Also enter the amount they have spent so far." The last code answered the question: "Determine what percentage of the company's total revenue, depending on the category of the film, is generated by the ten most active users"
